#Extrinsic parameter between IMU and Camera.
estimate_extrinsic: 0 # 0 Have an accurate extrinsic parameters. We will trust the following imu^R_cam, imu^T_cam, don't change it.
# 1 Have an initial guess about extrinsic parameters. We will optimize around your initial guess.
# 2 Don't know anything about extrinsic parameters. You don't need to give R,T. We will try to calibrate it. Do some rotation movement at beginning.
#If you choose 0 or 1, you should write down the following matrix.
#Rotation from camera frame to imu frame, imu^R_cam
